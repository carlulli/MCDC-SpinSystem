/***************************************************+***************************
This module should contain:
- the three spin models
- a wrapper function for the spin models
- a function that proposes new spin values
  * the propsed spin values also depend on the spin model
  * here the random seed counter needs to me remembered. (im not sure to what extend this is relevant)
- probably a function to intialize spin values for a hot start (all spins in opposite directions)
- in that case also a function for a cold start (all spins aligned in one direction)
